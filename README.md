## Getting and Cleaning Data: Class Project

The class project for [Getting and Cleaning Data](https://www.coursera.org/course/getdata) was to read in the ["Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" data set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones), perform an analysis on the data set, and output a tidy data set.

**Steps to reproduce:**

1. Download and unzip file from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
2. Copy the following files to the R script directory:
    * `features.txt`
    * `subject_train.txt`
    * `subject_test.txt`
    * `X_train.txt`
    * `X_test.txt`
    * `y_train.txt`
    * `y_test.txt`
3.Run the R script `run_analysis.R`

**The output of the R script is a tidy data set, tidy.csv.**
